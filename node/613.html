<p>
We are collecting questions regarding our RFP for creating a new website for us.  We will provide these questions and answers to these questions on this page of our website. Here is a smattering of some of them.  Including the way this looks when I copy and paste from word.  This requires loads of additional time to go into the html formatting to remove line returns that do not exist in original copy, but do when you copy and paste.  We don't have time for all of the board members to learn, read and understand html.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Branding and Identity:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Q     Are your current<br />
branding standards well-defined?
</p>
<p>
A     Yes.  We just went through a name change after 20<br />
years and have already been working with a logo designer.  No other branding besides that though since<br />
we are a small nonprofit.
</p>
<p>
Q     Are all identity<br />
and branding assets readily available or do they need to be generated?
</p>
<p>
A     Readily available
</p>
<p>
Q     Do you have a<br />
brand ID manual guideline that we could utilize right away?
</p>
<p>
A     No
</p>
<p>
Q     What's the depth<br />
of the current branding, is it limited to visuals?
</p>
<p>
A     Yes, just our<br />
logo
</p>
<p>
Q     Is tone and<br />
manner of your branding currently established? We would like to understand how<br />
this will impact website, visuals, collaterals, etc. and also, how you engage<br />
with members, future members, as well as project yourself to the public.
</p>
<p>
A     Not really,<br />
perhaps more discussion on what exactly they mean would help us tell them where<br />
we are at with branding.  Remind them we<br />
are not a corporation and we are very small so branding is not a high priority.  Our members know us...now of course going<br />
forward as we expand membership we want us (our &quot;brand&quot;) to be expanded, but I<br />
don't see them doing much with that other than making us a great website we can<br />
direct new members to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Membership Information</strong> (This information will be needed to be ported into the new<br />
website so you can start engaging with current members):
</p>
<p>
Q     What type of<br />
member information do you have?
</p>
<p>
A     Name, address,<br />
occupation, e-mail address, phone number (we do have how long they have been<br />
members if we dig it up, but it isn't readily available)
</p>
<p>
Q     In what format is<br />
the information currently in right now? (excel, db, csv, etc...)?
</p>
<p>
A     Excel
</p>
<p>
Q     Do you have a<br />
twitter and Facebook connection with your members?
</p>
<p>
A     We have accounts<br />
on Facebook and LinkedIn, so we are trying. <br />
We want to reach as many people as we can, this means using many<br />
different types of social networking within our ability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Current Marketing and PR efforts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Q<strong>     </strong>Please describe your current marketing<br />
efforts.
</p>
<p>
A<strong>     </strong>Posters in public places for each event
</p>
<p>
<strong>        </strong>E-mail to over 1,000 interested e-mail participants that<br />
we've collected over the years from those who have asked to be added to our<br />
e-mail list
</p>
<p>
Posting of our<br />
events on &quot;partner&quot; websites, i.e. MEP and SEEK
</p>
<p>
Q     If there is more<br />
than one marketing effort, please rank them in order of which one works the<br />
best and which one works the least.
</p>
<p>
A     Direct e-mail<br />
works the best, then likely posting on other websites, word of mouth and<br />
posters (which work the least).
</p>
<p>
Q     Are there current<br />
processes/protocol/methodology in place for:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Engaging with the public  
<ul>
<li>No</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing resources (sponsoring, co-branding, etc...)
<ul>
<li>No, but we have some history of it and are trying to increase<br />
			this. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Event related efforts
<ul>
<li>Yes, this is the heart of what we do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Membership invites?
<ul>
<li>Yes, invites to events that is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Website related:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Q<strong>     </strong>What is your projected website traffic<br />
(a day, on peaks - number of current users in peaks)?
</p>
<p>
A<strong>     </strong>At this time we do not know.
</p>
<p>
Q     Considering you<br />
have recently changed your name, can we also offer to redevelop your brand<br />
identity as part of your overall web/communications makeover?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Not at this time<br />
- we already have a new logo that is nearly ready.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     What are the<br />
&quot;members only&quot; features you are looking to provide members in the new<br />
website?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Private login to<br />
access other areas - jobs, look at other member's info, ask questions of other<br />
members
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
TBD, but we<br />
were thinking along the lines of only members getting access to job listings,<br />
linked in, and maybe a member &quot;chat&quot; forum. <br />
Maybe too we could do a &quot;member highlight&quot; each month (or week if we get<br />
enough interest) where one member gets highlighted on our website in terms of<br />
who they are, what job they have or want and what they do in the enviro field.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     Do you also want<br />
volunteers, sponsors, partners and others in the environmental community to be<br />
able to have login access as well? And if so what features do you want them to<br />
have?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Board members -<br />
yes, they should be able to edit the website. <br />
Possibly for sponsors to upload/deliver their logos to us, rather than<br />
using email.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     In terms of<br />
increasing financial support/donations and event attendance, do you currently<br />
use these services and what third-party vendors are you using now for online<br />
payments (outside of paypal), event registration gateway, etc.. Or do you need<br />
the winning vendor to make recommendations?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Event<br />
registration is through our website.  We<br />
have to set up all the parameters for each event - dates, event summary, codes,<br />
pricing, etc.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For payments we<br />
currently use PayPal.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
No other<br />
vendors are used, but we would welcome recommendations.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our event<br />
registration input system is not very user friendly or intuitive, so we would<br />
definitely want recommendations especially in relation to how it would work<br />
seamlessly with the website they provide and what they know of the pros and<br />
cons.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     How many members<br />
do you have now and do you have an anticipated percentage you want membership<br />
to grow as a result of this effort?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Around 50.  We would like to see at least 10% increases<br />
annually.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     Do you have any<br />
website analytics available for us to review?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Not that we are aware<br />
of.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     Do you have a<br />
preferred CMS and Asset Management Software you want integrated?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Not that I am aware<br />
of, but we prefer not to use Drupal or one that is considered very similar by<br />
industry standards.  We need a CMS that<br />
is more user friendly
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     You mentioned<br />
delivering online trainings for web administrators, how did you envision this<br />
would be featured in the website? Or were you just speaking in terms of the<br />
winning vendor training your team on how to use the website?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     The winning<br />
vendor would provide training to us.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It would be<br />
nice if there was a moodle or pod cast or something new board members could log<br />
into, click on and basically do a tutorial on how to navigate around the administration<br />
of our sight.  We could make it (with<br />
guidance maybe from the vendor) or if they had a predone one that would be<br />
great.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     How many products<br />
do you anticipate having in your shopping cart and do you want a custom<br />
shopping cart built or could the vendor use a third-party shopping cart?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
6 events annually
</p>
<p>
Membership
</p>
<p>
Donations
</p>
<p>
Sponsor an event - 3 or 4 different levels
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Third party is fine. <br />
Max 10, but really most likely 1 or 2 (people registering for one event<br />
or one event and a membership...but they could register multiple people). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     In<br />
terms of virtual groups and video meeting capabilities, how do you envision<br />
having these features integrated?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Password<br />
protected, website &quot;app&quot; that we click to join a virtual meeting.  That being said, I really don't think we need<br />
this with google video chat and other online meeting capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Q     You are asking<br />
for a sophisticated web development project with various custom programming for<br />
various features; but you stated that you are looking for a &quot;cost-effective<br />
website design&quot;. Can you disclose your total budget for this or at least<br />
an &quot;amount not to exceed&quot; for this project?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Around 3,000 K,<br />
maybe as high as 5,000 if payments could be spread out over time.  I stress here that we are not website creators,<br />
we are non profit environmentalists so we asked for all we could think of, but<br />
view this process as a conversation with &quot;experts&quot; on what we really can get<br />
for our money.  Therefore, line item<br />
costs (so we know what is really expensive and what isn't) and/or a &quot;minimal&quot;<br />
website vs &quot;the works&quot; would be helpful (and a willingness to work back and<br />
forth with us on what we really can get for our money). Again, we don't know<br />
what each web request translates to in terms of money and time.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Q     Are you looking<br />
for the lowest bidder and probono work or the best solution within your budget?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A     Best solution w/n<br />
our budget and again someone willing to work with us on what best meets our<br />
needs given our budget constraints (and perhaps someone willing to think creatively<br />
on how to get us what we need with our budget constraints, such as adding in<br />
probono work, having us do some of the transfer work, etc).  We have never done this before and are<br />
learning as we go.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Challenges we<br />
have encountered:  In our current website<br />
we have WYSIWYG feature where we type in all of our information.  Often, the formatting challenges us.  Typically double spacing when it should be<br />
single spaced, or changing to a smaller font, but it doesn't come out that<br />
way.  So, in order to change these I have<br />
to go into the html coding and remove the &lt;p&gt; and replace with<br />
&lt;br&gt;.  This is fine for me, but<br />
none of my other board members is familiar with html.  It should be a site that any of my board<br />
members can go in and edit without having to muck about with coding.
