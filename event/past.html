<strong>About our Guests</strong>
<br />
<br />
In <em>Before the Lights Go Out</em>, science blogger and NYTimes columnist <strong>Maggie Koerth-Baker</strong> presents a
comprehensive analysis of the ways in which America produces, distributes, and
consumes energy. She explains how our current systems developed, points out
their strengths and weaknesses, and offers candid assessments of the time, the
difficulty, and the expense involved in making radical changes to the energy
systems that have shaped our lives for a hundred years. Drawing on more than
two years of research and interviews with experts on everything from our
electrical grid and electric cars to fracking and passive buildings,
Koerth-Baker explains what we can do, what we can't do, and why &quot;the
solution&quot; is really a lot of solutions working together.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Ellen Anderson</strong> is an advisor on energy issues to Governor Mark Dayton.
She is a former member of the Minnesota Senate and a former nominated chair of
the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission will provide comments on Minnesota’s
current energy capacities, challenges and direction in light of the world’s
declining reserve of hydrocarbon-based energy sources.

The evening will begin at 5pm with light appetizers, Harriet 
brewery beer samples and networking.  This will be followed by a tour of
the brewery at 5:45pm.

<p>
Sponsors help the Forum run smoothly so that we can continue to organize informative events and provide important networking opportunities for professionals in the environmental field.  It's also a great way to advertise your company or organization, providing visibility on our website and in our e-newsletter.  The newsletter is sent out to over 1,200 professionals in our network three times in the six weeks prior to an event and reaches people in a variety of fields, including consultants, regulators, engineers, educators, and policy experts, among others.
</p>
<p>
We have three different sponsorship levels.

</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sponsor a full year of events for $300.00.</strong>  A sponsorship at this level entitles you to all the perks of the single sponsorship, times six!  Your company's logo would be displayed and linked on our website and in the newsletter for the entire year, and you would recieve free admission for one person to all six events, including meals.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sponsor our annual networking/information exchange event held in March for $100.00.</strong>  Sponsorship for this event entitles you to a table at the event and admission for two people from your company to staff the table and chat with our members and attendees.  Meals are included, and additonal staff are welcome to attend for the member rate of $12 each (to cover food costs).  Your company's name/logo would be linked on our website and in the newsletter for the six weeks prior to the event.  </li>

<p>
Think about how many personal care products you use in one day:  shampoo, lotion, deodorant, soap, lip balm, cosmetics, hair spray, shaving products, toothpaste and more. Children use a variety of daily products as well, including bubble bath, diaper cream, sunscreen, etc.  Have you ever looked at the labels of these products?  Are there any ingredients you recognize?
</p>
<p>
The Forum of Women in the Environmental Field invites you to join our discussion on toxins in everyday products.  Multiple organizations in Minnesota are looking into these products and alternatives, including studies done on Minnesota residents to measure the amount of environmental chemicals in people’s bodies.  The evening will start with a light dinner and networking, followed by the speaker presentations and Q &amp; A.

</p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Description:</strong>   
</p>
<p>
Join the FWEF for a tour of the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) near the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis campus.  The SAFL overlooks historic St. Anthony Falls just near the Riverplace/St. Anthony Main complex. The SAFL uses water flowing down the Mississippi River for research and education purposes.  Read more about the SAFL by going to:  <a href="http://www.safl.umn.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.safl.umn.edu/</a>   We will meet in the SAFL auditorium.  A light dinner will be provided.
</p>
<p>
We apologize.  Due to current construction/renovation of the building, it is not ADA accessible.  Stairs will be used.</p></p>
<p>
<strong>Agenda:</strong><br />
You may join the free SAFL seminar at 3:30. <em>The speaker is Brad Gemmell talking on The Perilous Life of Planktonic Copepods: Overcoming Hydrodynamic Contraints</em>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>3:30-4:30  seminar (optional, but highly recommended - plus you might find parking!)</li>
<li>5:30-6:15  registration, dinner, introductions, talk about the SAFL</li>
<li>6:15-7:30  tour of the SAFL</li>
<li>7:30 - ?    informal networking/happy hour at Tuggs (cost is on your own) (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Parking:  </strong>There is a parking lot, but parking is limited.  Parking might be more available if you come early for the seminar.  You can also park on the street and walk a few blocks.  The nearest public parking is the surface lot between University Avenue and Second Street, with the entrance on 3rd Avenue directly across from the entrance to the General Mills private employee parking lot. There is an unmanned pay station (cash only, but we are not 100% sure), the cost is around $2. If youp park there, then you walk out the corner of the lot closest the the intersection of 2nd Street and 3rd Avenue, and then walk down Third Avenue, cross Main Street, and continue down the driveway to our building.  The entrance is up and around through the black gates (a right turn just past the electric substation), then past a left turn to cross a bridge, and to the main entrance off to the left once across the bridge.
</p>

<strong>Best way to arrive at SAFL:</strong>  Carpool, take public transportation or bike.
