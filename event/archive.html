<strong><strong> July 25, 2007:</strong> Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, St. Paul </strong><br />
6:00   - 7:30 p.m.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Twenty adults and five children gathered at the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary on July 25, 2007 to hear about creation of this new St. Paul ecological attraction.  The evening started with Mexican gourmet sandwiches from Manny’s Tortas at an interpretative gathering circle at the entrance. The group then proceeded to tour the site via a walking trail that runs past gated caves, a spring-fed creek, and restored wetlands. Speakers included Carol Carey, Historic St. Paul Corporation; Ruth Murphy, Community Design Center; and four high school youth from the East Side Conservation Corps. The youth led the walking portion of the evening, providing site interpretation and personal insights on the reclamation effort, which included removing industrial trash and planting native vegetation. </p>
<p>The event was made waste free thanks to Eureka! Recycling and willing event participants.</p></p>

<strong>March 22, 2006: Minneapolis Water Works Ultrafiltration Plant</strong><br />
Water Works Ultrafiltration Plant, Columbia Heights, MN<br />
12 - 1:30 pm
</p>
<p>
At this event we learned about the largest ultrafiltration plant in the<br />
Western Hemisphere—the Minneapolis Water Works Ultrafiltration<br />
Plant—and observed first hand the workings of this state-of-the-art<br />
plant. City of Minneapolis employees, Dale Folen, project manager, and<br />
Annika Bankston, project engineer, spoke about the project's<br />
fascinating history and described the workings of the plant.
</p>
<p>
This new plant is the largest ultrafiltration plant in the Western<br />
Hemisphere. About 70 million gallons of water is filtered each day.<br />
Only two other plants in the world, one in Singapore and the other in<br />
Kuwait, filter more water using this process than the Minneapolis<br />
plant. The original water filtration plant, which was built between<br />
1913 and 1918, is now being phased out. Once all water production moves<br />
to the new plant, the older facility will be maintained as a backup<br />
system for a number of years before being dismantled.

</strong>REI, Bloomington, MN, 7:30 a.m.
</p>
<p>
A timely event—when the short daylight hours of a long winter can seem<br />
most daunting, and just when the challenge of current environmental<br />
issues can seem overwhelming. The gentle messages presented by Chris<br />
Heeter—stay the course, take heart, be hopeful (there is reason to be<br />
hopeful!), the work you do is critical—left the 54 people who attended<br />
